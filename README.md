## How to use primo

### primo Desktop
Create and manage sites locally & offline. Sites can be downloaded or deployed directly to available hosts. Each site is stored as a small JSON file in your directory of choice.

## How it compares

WordPress and proprietary site builders (Wix, Webflow, etc.) let you manage your content relatively easily, but make modifying your siteâ€™s source code a lot harder than just working directly with HTML files.

NextJS, Gatsby, Hugo, etc give you direct control over your site and enable more powerful functionality, but typically require a lot of upfront work and don't include a content management layer (unless you're cool with .MD files). 

Primo bridges these two sides by providing a built-in CMS for content management, a built-in IDE for development (using Svelte), and hosting integrations to make deploying site updates a breeze. It also includes a growing library of pre-built & fully integrated components so you can publish a freaky fast, easily-editable website in literal minutes. 

## Project Status

Primo version 2 is currently in Alpha. Where version 1 was focused on offering Primo as a hosted service, version 2 will be focused on polishing primo as a desktop and self-hosted application, with the potential to offer Primo as a hosted service again in the future should there be a demand for it.

## Contributing

The best way to contribute at the moment is by using the app and staying in close contact with us on how it's working (including bugs, deficiencies, and advantages). Once the Alpha's ready, we'll have a program for Alpha testers.
