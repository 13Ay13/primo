# primo

Primo is a new kind of site builder that combines simple content management with accessible custom development to make it quick and easy for anyone to build, manage, and publish freaky fast websites.

WordPress and proprietary site builders (Wix, Webflow, etc.) let you manage your content relatively easily, but make modifying your siteâ€™s source code a lot harder than just working directly with HTML files.

Instead of placing a no-code **wall** between you and your website's code, primo creates a **bridge** to the code so it's always immediately accessible. That way you have full access to the underlying platform and full control over your site. So every tweak/integration/customization is always a click away and doesn't need to be pre-engineered by an stressed out group of people in San Fransisco.

Effectively, isolating your site's design to its code where it belongs means that the UI can rid itself of color pickers, sliders, and complicated buttons. But more importantly, it means that the UI stays focused on the one thing that matters most to people who publish websites - **content**.

## Project Status

Our team's main priority at the moment is to offer primo as a service on [primo.af](https://primo.af), but once that's out of Beta we're shifting our focus to the self-hosted version of primo so that people can use it locally and have direct control over their data.

## Contributing

We've been super excited to have a lot of people ask how they can help out on the project, but while we're focused on getting primo.af (which is closed-source for the time being) to a good place the best way for people in the community to contribute is by opening discussions for issues and ideas, getting the word out, and just using the tool as much as possible to see where its limits are.
